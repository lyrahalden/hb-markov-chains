I was a child and she was a child,
   In this kingdom by the sea,
But we loved with a love that was more than love—
   I and my Annabel Lee—
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven
   Coveted her and me

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, "art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore-
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore!

It was many and many a year ago,
   in a kingdom by the sea,
for a maiden there lived whom you may know
   by the name of Annabel Lee;
for this maiden she lived with no other thought
   than to love and be loved by me

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
   of those who were older than we
   of many far wiser than we.

   for the beautiful Annabel Lee;
for the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes
   of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
for my darling, my darling, my love and my bride,
   in her sepulchre there by the sea--
   for her tomb by the side of the sea.

Be silent in that solitude
    which is not loneliness -- for then
The spirits of the dead who stood
    in life before thee are again
In death around thee -- and their will
Shall then overshadow thee: be still.

For the night -- tho' clear -- shall frown --
And the stars shall look not down,
